# Hypershift Audit Logs Forwarder

Hypershift logging forwarder is an operator that lives in each hosted control plane (HCP) namespace in management clusters.
The Hypershift Logging Operator combines data-plane and control-plane configuration on the control plane, so that the Cluster Logging Operator on the management cluster can forward API audit logs for both personas.
